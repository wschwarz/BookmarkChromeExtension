Description
  This Chrome extension automatically syncs bookmark actions to a web service
  (code located at http://github.com/wschwarz/Bookmark-Project). This allows
  for a seamless experience using the bookmark application under construction
  which will offer better grouping, tagging, and searching features than the 
  default browser currently offers.
